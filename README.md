# Double_Pendulum_Visualizer

A simple visualizer for the double pendulum and chaos with option for user defined initial conditions and parameters, made using the p5.js library.
The equations of motion for the double pendulum were obtained from both a Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approach and solved using the Euler Method for simplicity.
